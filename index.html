    <h1>Hypothesis : What affects my energy levels the most?</h1>
    <p>To create this visualization I collected the following data:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Amount of steps I walked in a day.</li>
      <li>Water Consumption in a day</li>
      <li>CalorieConsumption in a day</li>
      <li>Energy Levels (0 = Lazy and 5 = Energetic)</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      I collected the above data 4 times in a day - at 8 am, at 1 pm, at 6 pm
      and at 11 pm. 40 days of data has been adequate for me to come to a
      conclusion about how my Walking habits are affecting my Energy Levels.

    <h2>Visualization</h2>
    <p>
      The X axis reprsents the Amount of Steps (in Thousands) and the Y axis
      represents the Energy Levels. The circles are plotted accordingly. The
      circle size represents the amount of water consumed in a day. The colors
      represent the amount of calories consumed in a day.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have added a mouse over feature (tooltip). It displays the date, time,
      calorie amount, water level, Amount of steps, and Energy Levels for that
      observation. The slider at the top, makes this plot interactive. When the
      slider is moved, the circles animate from 8 am to 11pm. The color legend
      is Interactive as well. Once we click on a circle in the color legend,
      only the circle which has been clicked will be highlighted.

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      To Conclude, I now know the reasons for feeling less energetic on some
      days and more energetic on other days. Based on my visualization, we can
      see that Number of Steps I walk is having a major impact on my Energy
      Levels. Through this visualization, we can see that Calorie Consumption
      and Water Consumption do not seem to have as much impact as Amount of
      Steps do. The data that I have collected definitely proves my hypothesis,
      as I can see a pattern in my visualization and hypothesis.
